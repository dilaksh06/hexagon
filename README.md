Description: This Python script uses the turtle graphics module to create a colorful spiral pattern. 
The background is set to black, and the turtle draws 300 lines, changing colors cyclically through 
a list of six predefined colors: red, yellow, blue, green, purple, and orange. The turtle moves forward, 
increasing the distance with each step, 
and turns by 61 degrees to form a spiral-like effect. The script runs at the highest speed to create 
a dynamic, visually appealing design.
